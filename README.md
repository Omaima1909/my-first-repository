# my first repo

A collection of beginner Python projects and exercises — my first repo.

Purpose
- A learning playground for small Python projects (scripts, CLI tools, simple web apps, scrapers).
- Track progress and share what I learn.

How to run
- Each project will have its own folder and instructions.
- Example (future): create a venv and run `python main.py` inside a project folder.

Roadmap / TODO
- Add hello-cli project
- Add a simple Flask example
- Add tests and README for each project

Contributing
- This is a learning project — issues and friendly feedback are welcome.
- Open an issue if you want to suggest a project or help.

License
- (Add a license, e.g., MIT, when ready)
